            We are a group of veteran animation filmmakers. We want to do
            something new so we took a leap of faith into the NFT world. The
            question weâ€™ve been asking ourselves is: is it possible to embrace
            DAO in filmmaking? And here we are with 10,000 procedurally
            generated movie titles about Sam.
