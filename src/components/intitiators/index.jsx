              We are a group of veteran animation filmmakers who were let down
              by the culture of big Hollywood studios. We want to do something
              new so we took a leap of faith into the NFT world. The question
              weâ€™ve been asking ourselves is: is it possible to embrace DAO in
              filmmaking? And here we are with 10,000 procedurally generated
              movie titles about Sam.{' '}
